    <h2>So what is HTML?</h2>
    <p>HTML is not a programming language; it is a markup language that defines the structure of your content.</p>
    <p>HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way</p>
